Git Clone copies an exisitng repository. This essentially works by cloning a repository into a new directory. It is important to remember that this is a seperate environment from the original repository. When you clone remote tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository will be created. These can be updated with git fetch.

Git clone is useful if you want a copy of a project in order to look at the code, it is also useful if you are collaborating on a project.
